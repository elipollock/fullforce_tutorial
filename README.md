**Date**: August 7, 2019

**Authors**: Eli Pollock (MIT)


## Instructions
1. The code uses Python 3, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. You'll also need [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) to run the interactive notebooks.

## Background reading
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a popular kind of model in computational neuroscience. A number of algorithms now exist for training RNNs. This tutorial focuses on a type of training algorithm originally introduced in [Sussillo and Abbott, 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627309005479?via%3Dihub) and expanded upon in [DePasquale et al., 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0191527).
